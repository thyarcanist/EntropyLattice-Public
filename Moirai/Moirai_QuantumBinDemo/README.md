Size: 1MB

## Package Contents

1. `quantum_raw.bin` - Raw quantum random data
2. `quantum_whitened.bin` - Whitened quantum random data (for cryptographic use)
3. `verification.txt` - Verification certificate with hashes
4. `usage_examples.md` - Examples of how to use the quantum data
5. `quality_report/` - Detailed entropy quality analysis

## What Makes This Data Special

This package contains **genuine quantum-derived randomness** with:

- **Raw Quantum Signature: Chi-Square ~16.15 Million** � Statistical proof of quantum behavior
- **Benchmark Whitened Quality Score: 0.99998** � Exceeds cryptographic requirements (based on 10MB test)
- **Dual-Mode Delivery**: Both raw quantum chaos and refined cryptographic-grade randomness
- **Military-Grade Processing**: Toeplitz Matrix + XOR Cascade whitening

## Using This Data

See `usage_examples.md` for detailed code examples on how to use this quantum random data for:

- Cryptographic key generation
- One-time pad encryption
- Cryptocurrency wallet creation
- Secure password generation
- Random art generation

## Security Notice

This data is provided for public and demonstration use.
Do not use this publicly available bin for cryptographic keys.
