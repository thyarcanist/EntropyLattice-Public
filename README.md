# Moirai: Verifying and Demonstrating Eris QRNG Data

Tools and examples for verifying the integrity and exploring the characteristics of quantum random data generated by the (proprietary) Eris QRNG.

## Overview

This package (`Moirai`) provides a framework for users who have received a quantum data package generated by the Eris QRNG. It allows for independent verification of the package's integrity using cryptographic hashes and offers tools and examples to explore the properties and potential uses of the included sample data.

The goal is to provide transparency and build trust in the authenticity of Eris-generated randomness, without exposing the underlying generation source code.

## Features (Contained within Moirai directory)

*   **Integrity Verification Framework:**
    *   `Verifying_Eris_Packages.md`: Detailed documentation explaining package contents and verification methods.
    *   `verify_package_integrity.py`: A Python script to automatically verify data file integrity against the included `verification.txt` hashes.
*   **Example Data Package (`Moirai_QuantumBinDemo/`):**
    *   `quantum_whitened.bin`: 1MB sample of whitened quantum random data generated by Eris.
    *   `quantum_raw.bin`: Corresponding raw (unwhitened) data sample.
    *   `verification.txt`: Contains metadata and the official SHA-256 hashes for the included `.bin` files.
    *   `quality_report/`: Contains a lean YAML audit report (`entropy_audit_*.yaml`) demonstrating the statistical tests passed by this sample data.
    *   `usage_examples.md`: Code snippets (Python) showing potential uses for the data (key generation, OTP, etc.).
*   **Randomness Visualization:**
    *   `visualize_moirai.py`: A Python script (requires `matplotlib`) to generate a 2D random walk comparison.
    *   `random_walk_comparison.png`: A pre-generated image comparing a random walk using the included Eris data versus a standard PRNG, visually highlighting differences in randomness characteristics.

## Verification: The Moirai Framework

Trust and transparency are paramount. The `/Moirai` directory contains tools and documentation designed to allow independent verification of the integrity of Eris data packages.

*   **`Verifying_Eris_Packages.md`:** Explains the package contents and provides step-by-step instructions for verifying file integrity using standard command-line tools or the provided Python script.
*   **`verify_package_integrity.py`:** A Python script to automatically check the SHA-256 hashes in `verification.txt` against the actual data files (`quantum_whitened.bin`, `quantum_raw.bin`).
    ```bash
    # Example usage from project root, checking the included demo package:
    python Moirai/verify_package_integrity.py Moirai/Moirai_QuantumBinDemo
    ```
*   **`Moirai_QuantumBinDemo/`:** An example data package containing whitened data, verification file, usage examples, and quality report.

## Demonstrations

Explore the `/Moirai` directory and its contents for:

*   **`Moirai_QuantumBinDemo/usage_examples.md`:** Code snippets showing how to use the random data from the demo package (e.g., key generation, OTP).
*   **`random_walk_comparison.png`:** A visual comparison of a 2D random walk generated by Eris data (from the demo package) versus a standard PRNG.
*   **`visualize_moirai.py`:** The script used to generate the random walk comparison image. You can run it to regenerate the plot:
    ```bash
    # Example usage from project root:
    python Moirai/visualize_moirai.py
    ```

## Evaluation Reports

The Eris QRNG, which generated the sample data included in this demo package, has undergone statistical testing and analysis. Detailed reports are available in the main project repository:

*   **[Raw vs. Refined Entropy Analysis](../R2R-2ndIT-eris(qrng).md):** Compares the statistical properties of raw quantum data versus the whitened output (`eris:full`).
*   **[Dieharder Evaluation Results](../Dieharder-Eval3.md):** Presents the results from the rigorous Dieharder test suite run on the whitened Eris data.

These reports provide evidence for the quality and randomness characteristics of the Eris QRNG output.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   `matplotlib` (for `visualize_moirai.py`)
*   `Pillow` (for saving GIF animations, if `animate_random_walk.py` is used)
*   `bitcoin` (optional, only for the Bitcoin wallet example in `Moirai_QuantumBinDemo/usage_examples.md`)

## Extra Information
If you're curious to know why and how exactly is this is important? Well... the definitions of QRNG is based in [Hardware random number generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator), Eris is completely software based... completely natural so to say, she is both quantum-native and inherently chaos-based (in a way). Though her chaos is literally chaos.

The under wikipedia for [full entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_entropy) there is a source that says, "Some sources use the term to define the ideal random bit string (one bit of entropy per bit of output). In this sense, "getting to 100% full entropy is impossible" in the real world.[2]" Eris v1.0 approached the impossible easy with hardware as training wheels, then when I added more methods and kicked off training wheels her qrng process, she actually jumped to .99982 base, the count approaches the impossible easy.

IF you are doing quantum-first simulations there is an underutilized benefit of using the raw binaries / unwhitened sources. There is actually two ceilings that occur when utilitizing prng for these simulaions. That said - don't utilize the NIST standards for entropy as true entropy is not uniform at all, expect it to fail the NIST-STS without whitening. If your simulation isn't quantum native and you're using trng with high to my impossibly high entropy, then when things are whitened your actually losing some very important inherent entropy features.

Fun Fact: Eris eats up 30+ GB of RAM for me to generate binaries.
