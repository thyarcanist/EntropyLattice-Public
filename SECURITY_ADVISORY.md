# EntropyLattice Security Advisory

**PUBLIC DOCUMENT - Version 1.0 - March 16, 2025**

This advisory provides information about the current security status of EntropyLattice. As a developing cryptographic framework, we are committed to transparency about security considerations while following responsible disclosure practices.

## Current Status

EntropyLattice 1.0.0 is currently designated as an **evaluation release**. This means:

- The framework is suitable for research, experimentation, and evaluation purposes
- It is **not recommended for production use** or protecting sensitive information
- We are actively working to improve security in upcoming releases

## Security Principles

The EntropyLattice framework is being developed with adherence to core cryptographic principles:

1. **Kerckhoff's Principle**: Security should depend solely on the key, not the secrecy of the algorithm
2. **Schneier's Law**: Any person can create an algorithm they themselves cannot break
3. **Transparency**: Open evaluation and improvement based on rigorous testing

## Known Security Considerations

Our security testing has identified several areas that require improvement before EntropyLattice can be considered production-ready:

### Critical Areas

- **Implementation Encapsulation**: Some internal components have implementation details that are more exposed than ideal
- **Key Management**: The current key derivation and management system needs strengthening
- **License Verification**: The license verification system needs additional hardening against bypass attempts

### Other Considerations

- Potential side-channel vulnerabilities in timing-sensitive operations
- Memory handling improvements needed for secure erasure of sensitive data
- Additional entropy sources required for certain high-security applications

## Roadmap for Security Improvements

We have a defined roadmap for addressing these issues:

| Version | Focus | Estimated Timeline |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| v1.1.0  | Critical fixes: implementation encapsulation and key management | Q2 2025 |
| v1.2.0  | Memory handling and side-channel mitigation | Q3 2025 |
| v2.0.0  | Production-ready release with comprehensive security hardening | Q4 2025 |

## Recommendations for Evaluators

If you're evaluating EntropyLattice, we recommend:

1. **Test Environment Only**: Use in isolated test environments
2. **No Sensitive Data**: Do not use with sensitive or confidential information
3. **Report Issues**: Help us improve by reporting any security concerns
4. **Stay Updated**: Follow our release announcements for security updates

## Reporting Security Issues

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security issues:

- Email: datorien@occybyte.dev
- Include "EntropyLattice Security" in the subject line
- Provide detailed information about how to reproduce the issue

## About Occybyte Security Testing

EntropyLattice undergoes rigorous security testing, including:

- Static analysis and code review
- Specialized "cracking" tests to evaluate robustness
- Memory profiling to detect sensitive data exposure
- Extreme testing under unusual conditions
- Peer review by cryptography experts

These tests are continuously evolving as we work toward a production-ready implementation that follows industry best practices for cryptographic security.
